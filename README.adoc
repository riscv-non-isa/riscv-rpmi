= RISC-V RPMI Specification

RPMI (RISC-V Platform Management Interface) is an extensible messaging 
interface between Application Processors and Platform microcontrollers for
management and control of system.

This specification is based on an earlier draft located here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/199ar3Ddd-FlzP1FR3HOkbBf1BNvLUPvJ/edit

= Build Documents
This project uses
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[GitHub Submodules] to
include the RISC-V
https://github.com/riscv/docs-resources[docs-resources project] to achieve a
common look and feel.

When cloning this repository for the first time, you must either use
`git clone --recurse-submodules` or execute `git submodule init` and
`git submodule update` after the clone to populate the `docs-resources`
directory. Failure to clone the submodule, will result in the PDF build
fail with an error message.

The final specification in form of PDF and HTML can be generated using
`make` command. The `makefile` internally uses asciidoctor so the packages
required by the `makefile` need to be installed on the build system using
`make install-debs` or `make install-rpms`.

[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-rpmi

git submodule init && git submodule update

make
