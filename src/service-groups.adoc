== Service Groups
An RPMI service group is a collection of RPMI services that are logically
grouped based on functionality. For example, all the voltage related services
are grouped into a voltage service group. The functionality implemented by
certain RPMI service groups may impact the architectural state of application
processors due to this each RPMI service group specifies the RISC-V privilege
levels of the application processor which can be access it. For example, the
clock service groups can be accessed from M-mode and S-mode but the HSM service
group can be only accessed from M-mode.

All RPMI service groups except the BASE service group are optional. If
the `BASE_PROBE_SERVICE_GROUP` service indicates that a service group is
implemented then the RPMI service group version must conform to the RPMI
specification version returned by the `BASE_GET_SPEC_VERSION` service.
All implemented RPMI service groups must satisfy the following requirements:

. The RPMI service group must be accessible from the RISC-V privilege
level associated with the RPMI context which includes it.
. All RPMI services of the RPMI service groups must be supported except
the dedicated notification service (`SERVICE_ID = 0x00`) which is reserved
for RPMI notification messages. A RPMI service group may be partially
implement its RPMI services only if defines mechanism to discover supported
RPMI services.
. The RPMI service group must implement a dedicated RPMI service with
`SERVICE_ID = 0x01` to subscribe for event notifications.

NOTE: The RPMI services listed within each RPMI service group do not have
a specific order. Additionally, the sequence in which services are defined
in the specification does not necessarily reflect the order in which they
should be invoked.

This specification defines standard RPMI service groups and RPMI services
with the provision to add more service groups as required in the future.
The platform vendors can provide implementation specific RPMI service groups.
The <<table_service_groups>> below list all standard RPMI service groups
defined by this specification.
