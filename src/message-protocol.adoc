== Messaging Protocol
The RPMI messaging protocol includes all the RPMI messages exchanged over
a RPMI transport channel.

=== Message Types
The RPMI messaging protocol defines three types of RPMI messages namely:
*REQUEST*, *ACKNOWLEDGEMENT* and *NOTIFICATION*. The <<messaging_message_types_table>>
below summarize all RPMI message types.

An *RPMI request message* represents a specific control and management task
which needs to be performed and it is also referred to as an *RPMI service*.
Multiple related RPMI services are grouped logically into an *RPMI service
group* such as Clock, Voltage, Performance, etc. Depending on the RPMI service,
a RPMI request message may carry data required to perform the control and
management task. An RPMI request message may have an associated response which
is send back as an *RPMI acknowledgement message* on the same RPMI transport
channel. The RPMI acknowledgement message carries the status and optional
response data from an RPMI request after it has been processed.

An RPMI request message which has an associated RPMI acknowledgement message
is referred to as a *NORMAL REQUEST* otherwise it is referred to as a *POSTED
REQUEST*.

An *RPMI notification message* is an asynchronous message from the platform
microcontroller to the application processors which is used to inform the later
about certain events that have occurred in the system. There is no response
required for an RPMI notification message from the application processors.

=== Message Format
An RPMI message consists of a fixed `8-byte` message header followed by a
variable sized optional message data as show in the <<messaging_format>>
below. The byte ordering of an RPMI message is defined by the underlying
RPMI transport.

==== Message Layout Tables
The RPMI message header and message data are split into multiple *words*,
where each word is `4-byte` wide and indexed starting from `0`. The RPMI
message layout is presented throughout the RPMI specification in the form
of tables as shown in the <<table_message_layout_table_example>> below.
Some of the columns listed below may be omitted in the layout tables if
not required.

==== Message Header
The layout of the `8-byte` wide RPMI message header is shown in the
<<table_message_header>> below. The RPMI message header provide an
unique identity to the corresponding RPMI message withing an RPMI
context.

|===

For an RPMI normal request message, the `TOKEN`, `SERVICEGROUP_ID`, and
`SERVICE_ID` fields of the RPMI acknowledgment message must have the same
values as corresponding fields in the RPMI request message. The `DATALEN`
field of the RPMI acknowledgment message must be set according to the data
carried by this acknowledgement.

For an RPMI notification message, the platform microcontroller will set
appropriate values for the `TOKEN`, `SERVICEGROUP_ID`, and `DATALEN` fields
whereas `SERVICE_ID` field must be always set to `0x0`.

==== Message Data
The message data of an RPMI message is optional and variable sized. The
maximum message data size of an RPMI message depends on the underlying
RPMI transport implementation.

The message data carries different information based on the RPMI message type:

* An RPMI request message carries data required to perform the control and
management task
* An RPMI acknowledgement message carries the status and optional response data
* An RPMI notification message carries an array of RPMI events

The message data format for RPMI request message and RPMI acknowledgement
message is defined separately for each RPMI service. The message data format
for RPMI notification message is defined in the <<Notifications>>.

An RPMI acknowledgement message must have a signed `STATUS` field as the
first 4-byte word of the message data containing an error code defined in
the <<Possible Error Codes>>. An RPMI service where the response data exceeds
the maximum message data size can use multipart RPMI acknowledgement messages.

=== Notifications
The platform microcontroller can use RPMI notification message to notify
application processors about system events which are also referred to as
*RPMI events*. An RPMI notification message has no associated response or
acknowledgement from application processors. Multiple RPMI events can be
packed into a single RPMI notification message depending on the space
available in the message data. Each RPMI event may have additional data
associated with it based on the type of RPMI event. Any action required
for handling an RPMI event depends on the application processors. The
format of an RPMI notification message in shown in the <<messaging_notif_format>>
below.

The RPMI events are defined separately for each RPMI service group. An
RPMI service group must have a `ENABLE_NOTIFICATION` service with a fixed
`SERVICE_ID=0x01` which can be used by the application processors to enable
notification messages for a particular RPMI event defined by the RPMI service
groups. By default, notifications are disabled for all RPMI events of an RPMI
service group. The platform microcontroller only sends RPMI notification
messages for RPMI events which are enabled by the application processors.
If multiple RPMI events are supported by an RPMI service group then the
application processors must enable to each RPMI event individually.

[#messaging_notif_format]
.RPMI Notification Message Format
image::notification-format.png[500,600, align="center"]

==== Events
An RPMI event consists of a header containing two fields: `EVENT_ID (8-bit)`
and `EVENT_DATALEN (16-bit)`. An RPMI event may have associated data who's
size is specified in the `EVENT_DATALEN` field of header and this data size
must be a multiple of `4-byte`.

The number of RPMI events that can be stored in a single RPMI notification
message depends on the maximum RPMI message data size. The `DATALEN` field
in the RPMI message header represents the aggregate size of all RPMI events
included in RPMI message data.

The <<table_notification_message_format>> below defines the format of an
RPMI event whereas the <<messaging_event_format>> below shows a pictorial
view of an RPMI event. The format of the event data for each RPMI event is
defined separately by an RPMI service group. If multiple RPMI events are
packed into a single RPMI notification message then the ordering of RPMI
events within the RPMI notification message is implementation defined.
