===  Service Group - MANAGEMENT_MODE (SERVICEGROUP_ID: 0x000A)
This MANAGEMENT_MODE service group is designed to be used for software invocation
of Management Mode (MM) in a secure execution environment. For general background
on Management Mode, refer to the Platform Initialization (PI) specifications
cite:[PI], Volume 4: Management Mode Core Interface. Management Mode provides an
environment for implementing OS agnostic services (MM services) like secure variable
storage, and firmware updates in system firmware. This service group describes the
interfaces for invoking MM services synchronously, the `MM_COMMUNICATE` serves as the
world-switch synchronous call from the non-secure to the secure world while the
`MM_COMPLETE` facilitates synchronous call from the secure to the non-secure world.

The following table lists the services in the MANAGEMENT_MODE service group:

[#management-notifications]
==== Notifications
This service group does not support any event for notification.

==== Service: MM_ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (SERVICE_ID: 0x01)
This service allows the application processor to subscribe to MANAGEMENT_MODE
service group notifications. Platform can optionally support notifications of
events which might occur in the platform. Platform microcontroller can send
these notification messages to application processor if they are implemented
and application processor has subscribed to these. Events supported are described
in <<management-notifications>>.

==== Service: MM_COMMUNICATE (SERVICE_ID: 0x03)
This service invokes an MM service implemented in the secure execution
environment. The `MM_COMM_DATA` contains data needed to identify and
invoke the MM service. The readiness of this synchronous request from
the non-secure world is signaled by the `MM_COMPLETE` call from the secure
world.

==== Service: MM_COMPLETE (SERVICE_ID: 0x04)
This service is used as the world-switch synchronous call, typically at the end
of a synchronous `MM_COMMUNICATE` call, to signal the readiness for handling
the synchronous request. The `MM_COMM_DATA` contains the returned data from the
invoked MM service.
